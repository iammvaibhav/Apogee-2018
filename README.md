A melange of technology, innovation and inspiration across space and time of humankind, this technical conference will, as always, play host to the brightest minds and thinkers in the country and world. From presenting papers and projects at the oldest-of-its-kind events in the country, developing amazing solutions to real-life cases and problems, exhibitions of the best contraptions that man has made, guest lectures that tell stories never heard before, to the collegeâ€™s own literature festival, APOGEE challenges the intellect of the participants and piques the minds of the audience.
